Elizabeth (Liz) Duguid (nee Godley) of Calgary, AB passed away unexpectedly at age 75 on May 31, 2023, after a brief illness.

Liz was the loving and much-loved wife of Carle for 47 happy years and proud mother of Jennifer Duguid and Christopher Duguid (Julie). She will be lovingly remembered by her family, including her three granddaughters, Cassandra Grooters-Duguid, Charlotte and Lily Duguid, her sister Bonnie, her sister-in-law Marni (Duguid) Angus of Richmond Hill, ON, as well as nieces, nephews, and many friends.

She was predeceased by her parents, Frank and Betty Godley, her brothers Barry and Darryl, and her beloved husband Carle.

Born in Moose Jaw, the youngest of four, Liz grew up in a musical household. She swore she'd never marry a musician—and then she did, and never looked back. She met Carle in Medicine Hat, and he became the love of her life. People who knew them marveled that after 30 years of marriage they still walked down the street holding hands. They were still doing it after 47.

When they first got married, Liz worked as a teacher's aide. Later, for many years, she worked in children's clothing stores. She was a natural salesperson—not because she was pushy, but because she was genuinely enthusiastic about everything. She loved things, was fascinated by them, and wanted to share that excitement with everyone she met. Her warmth and curiosity made people feel like they'd made a friend, not just a purchase.

Liz was, simply put, unforgettable. A little bit zany, a lot of fun, and a dynamic force in any room she entered. She was warm, generous, deeply social, and talked a mile a minute. She loved meeting new people and made friends wherever she went. She'd wake up singing and keep at it throughout the day—old classics from her youth, pulled out whenever they fit the moment. Same with her jokes: she had her favorites and wasn't shy about repeating them, year after year. If you knew Liz, you knew Liz. There was no one else quite like her.

She loved her children and grandchildren fiercely, and showed it through her attention, her generosity, and her unwavering support. She loved to shop—especially for gifts for others. She loved to travel and try new things. If something was new, silly, and fun, she was first in line to try it, buy it, or do it.

She and Carle were inseparable, perfect complements to each other. His quiet steadiness and her bright energy made them a pair that everyone who knew them admired. Now they're together again.
