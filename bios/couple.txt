In 2022 and 2023, within just fourteen months of each other, Liz and Carle both passed away unexpectedly. They left behind a life fully lived—together.

They met in Medicine Hat, introduced by her mother, who clearly knew what she was doing, and were married within months. And then for 47 years, they built and lived a happy life together. They raised two children, welcomed three granddaughters, and were always surrounded by friends and family who loved and adored them.

They shared a sense of adventure and loved to travel and explore. But even on ordinary days, if Carle was driving around to teach lessons, Liz would ride along just to be with him. At one point early on, they packed up the whole family and moved to Texas for a few years so Carle could pursue his PhD... and poor students or not, they loved every minute of it. That was them—they were on the journey together.

People who knew them always said they seemed like a perfect couple, and they were. His quiet steadiness and her bright energy made them a pair that just worked. After more than 30 years of marriage, they were still walking down the street holding hands. They were still doing it after 47.

Still together.
