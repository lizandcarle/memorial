In 2022 and 2023, within fourteen months of each other, Liz and Carle both passed away unexpectedly. 

They met in Medicine Hat back in 1973 (introduced by her mother Betty, who clearly knew what she was doing), and were married within months. And then for 47 years, they built and lived a happy life together, raising a family, welcoming three granddaughters, and spending their lives among friends and family who appreciated their unique spirits and friendship.

They shared a sense of adventure and loved to travel and explore, sometimes on the spur of the moment. Even on ordinary days, if Carle was driving around to teach lessons, Liz would ride along just to be with him. Moving to Texas for school, going on vacation, travelling for work, or just driving around town... when they went, they went together.

People who knew them always said they seemed like a perfect couple, and they were. His quiet steadiness and her bright energy made them a pair that just worked. After more than 30 years of marriage, they were still walking down the street holding hands. They were still doing it after 47.

Still together.
