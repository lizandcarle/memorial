In 2022 and 2023, within fourteen months of each other, both Liz and Carle passed away unexpectedly and far too soon. 

They met in Medicine Hat (introduced by her mother Betty, who clearly knew what she was doing), and were married within months. And then for 47 years, they built and lived a happy life together. They raised two children, welcomed three granddaughters, and lived their lives among friends and family who loved them and appreciated their unique spirits and friendship.

They shared a sense of adventure and passion to travel and explore. But even on ordinary days, they were well matched. If Carle was driving around to teach lessons, Liz would ride along just to be with him. At one point early on, they packed up the whole family and moved to Texas for a few years so Carle could pursue his PhD, and poor students or not, they made the most of every minute of it. That was them in a nutshell... They were on the journey together.

People who knew them always said they seemed like a perfect couple, and they were. His quiet steadiness and her bright energy made them a pair that just worked. After more than 30 years of marriage, they were still walking down the street holding hands. They were still doing it after 47.

Still together.
