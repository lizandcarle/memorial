Carle Douglas Duguid of Calgary, AB passed away unexpectedly at age 73 on Friday, March 18, 2022, after a brief illness.

Carle was the loving and much-loved husband of Elizabeth (nee Godley) for 47 happy years and proud father of Jennifer Duguid and Christopher Duguid (Julie). He will be lovingly remembered by his family, including his three granddaughters, Cassandra Grooters-Duguid, Charlotte and Lily Duguid, his sister, Marni (Duguid) Angus of Richmond Hill, ON as well as nieces, nephews, and many friends, colleagues, and students. 

He was predeceased by his parents, Scot and Marguerite Duguid.

Carle spent a lifetime in music education and sharing the joy of music. He received early training in violin in Calgary. He successfully auditioned for the Calgary Youth Orchestra, playing for seven years, and becoming Concertmaster. He earned a B.Ed in Music from the University of Alberta, an M. Ed in Music from the University of Victoria and a PhD in Fine Arts from Texas Tech University.

He began his teaching career in St. Paul, Alberta and then moved to Medicine Hat to assist in developing the music and dance conservatory program at Medicine Hat College. While in Medicine Hat, Carle became head of the Department of Fine Arts as well as being involved with the Medicine Hat Musical Theatre, Medicine Hat Symphony, and Fifth Avenue United Church senior choir. This is where he met the love of his life and started his family.

In 1992, he became president of Scot's Music Centre in Calgary and opened his own music studio. He began examining for the Western Board of Music (eventually Conservatory Canada). He played violin in the Calgary Civic Symphony and Rocky Mountain Symphony Orchestra. He sang in Sing Out Edmonton, Les Musicos (St. Paul), MRC Kantorei, West Winds Choral Ensemble, as well as church choirs in Edmonton, St. Paul, Medicine Hat, Lubbock, Tx and Calgary.

Carle's students had great success, a number of them pursuing professional careers in music, and attaining high grades in both Conservatory Canada and Royal Conservatory of Music exams (including highest marks in Canada). Carle also enjoyed conducting and especially enjoyed directing church ensembles.

Carle loved spending time with his family. He loved trains and travelling and enjoyed helping others with their travel plans. Family and friends will remember Carle as a calm, thoughtful and a gentle soul. His quiet strength and a caring heart guided him through life. Our lives have been shaped and enriched by his legacy of beautiful music and the wealth of memories he has bestowed on each of us. These pieces of him we will hold tightly in our hearts forever.
