Carle Douglas Duguid of Calgary, AB passed away unexpectedly at age 73 on Friday, March 18, 2022, after a brief illness.

Carle was the loving and much-loved husband of Elizabeth (nee Godley) for 47 happy years and proud father of Jennifer Duguid and Christopher Duguid (Julie). Liz used to joke that he had three great loves in his life—her and the kids, music, and trains—and she wasn't sure in what order. Everyone laughed, but the truth was plain as day: Liz and the kids were first. He adored her and was above all a loving dad.

He is lovingly remembered by his family, including his three granddaughters, Cassandra Grooters-Duguid, Charlotte and Lily Duguid, his sister, Marni (Duguid) Angus of Richmond Hill, ON, as well as nieces, nephews, and many friends, colleagues, and students.

He was predeceased by his parents, Scot and Marguerite Duguid.

Carle spent a lifetime in music education and sharing the joy of music. It was Dvořák, he once said, who convinced him to become a professional violinist. He received early training in violin in Calgary, successfully auditioned for the Calgary Youth Orchestra, played for seven years, and became Concertmaster. He earned a B.Ed in Music from the University of Alberta, an M.Ed in Music from the University of Victoria, and a PhD in Fine Arts from Texas Tech University.

He began his teaching career in St. Paul, Alberta, then moved to Medicine Hat to assist in developing the music and dance conservatory program at Medicine Hat College. While there, Carle became head of the Department of Fine Arts and threw himself into the community—Medicine Hat Musical Theatre, Medicine Hat Symphony, and the Fifth Avenue United Church senior choir. This is where he met the love of his life and started his family.

In 1992, he became president of Scot's Music Centre in Calgary and opened his own music studio. He began examining for the Western Board of Music (eventually Conservatory Canada). He played violin in the Calgary Civic Symphony and Rocky Mountain Symphony Orchestra. He sang in Sing Out Edmonton, Les Musicos (St. Paul), MRC Kantorei, West Winds Choral Ensemble, as well as church choirs in Edmonton, St. Paul, Medicine Hat, Lubbock, TX, and Calgary. Whether playing in an orchestra, at a wedding, or leading a church ensemble, he found joy in every note.

Carle's students had great success, a number of them pursuing professional careers in music and attaining high grades in both Conservatory Canada and Royal Conservatory of Music exams—including highest marks in Canada. He loved his students, and they knew it.

Beyond his professional accomplishments, Carle was a man who showed up—for his community and anyone who needed a hand. He always was ready to serve on church boards of elders, was a longtime and enthusiastic Rotarian, and once served several terms as a provincial union leader for college teachers. Easy-going to a fault, he nonetheless carried a quiet conviction about fairness and treating people with respect.

And then there were the trains. Carle didn't just love trains—he loved train schedules, collecting them the way others might collect stamps. Given the chance, he'd drive out to the Spiral Tunnels and wait, watching for the scheduled trains to wind through the mountains. Or drag his family out to some random field to watch the trains pass by there. It was pure contentment. He loved to travel and to help others plan their trips, poring over routes and timetables with genuine enthusiasm.

Somehow both quiet and chatty, Carle made friends wherever he went. He was conscientious, diligent, gentle—and deeply loved. Family and friends will remember him as a calm, thoughtful, and gentle soul. His quiet strength and caring heart guided him through life. Our lives have been shaped and enriched by his legacy of beautiful music and the wealth of memories he has bestowed on each of us. These pieces of him we will hold tightly in our hearts forever.

Memorial tributes in memory of Carle may always be made directly to the Calgary Performing Arts Festival.
